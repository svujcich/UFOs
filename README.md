## Overview
In this project, the topic of UFOs is explored through the creation of an interacive webpage, which filters search results about various UFO sightings based user input. First an html page was constructed to display the content. The page was styled using css and bootstrap elements. A javascript app was then created to construct a complete table on the html page using a data file. When a user enters a search perameter, the javascript app stores the value associated with the
search criteria in a dictionary, and rebuilds the table to show only the desired results of the user. The html page features five filters for the user to search with (Date, City, State, Country, and shape) which can be used in any combination to show results refined on multiple criteria.
